# Time Is Money - Project Setup TODO Index

The original TODO list has been split into multiple focused files based on scope analysis. This approach improves focus, reduces complexity, and enables parallel work on different parts of the project setup.

## TODO Files (In Recommended Implementation Order)

1. [**TODO-1-Docs.md**](TODO-1-Docs.md) - Project documentation
   - README.md enhancements
   - LICENSE file
   - Contribution guidelines
   
2. [**TODO-2-Infra-CI.md**](TODO-2-Infra-CI.md) - Setting up GitHub Actions CI pipeline
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - Test/linting configuration in CI
   - Coverage reporting
   
3. [**TODO-3-DevWorkflow-Quality.md**](TODO-3-DevWorkflow-Quality.md) - Developer workflow and code quality
   - Git hooks (pre-commit, post-commit, pre-push)
   - Code quality standards
   - Conventional commits & semantic versioning
   
4. [**TODO-4-Frontend.md**](TODO-4-Frontend.md) - Frontend development stack
   - Storybook configuration
   - Component testing setup
   - Styling strategy
   - State management & accessibility

## Implementation Order Reasoning

This recommended order is based on:

1. **Documentation first** - Provides project context and clarity for all subsequent work
2. **CI Infrastructure second** - Establishes automated checking and validation for future changes  
3. **Developer Workflow third** - Sets up local development process with Git hooks and quality enforcement
4. **Frontend Stack last** - Builds on the established infrastructure and quality controls

While these tasks can be tackled in parallel by multiple team members, the numbering provides a logical sequence for a single developer approach.
