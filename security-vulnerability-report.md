# Security Vulnerability Report

## Summary

The security audit identified **2 high severity vulnerabilities** in the project's dependencies. Both vulnerabilities are related to the same issue in the `cross-spawn` package, which is a dependency of the `pre-commit` package.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in cross-spawn

- **Severity**: High
- **Package**: cross-spawn (versions < 6.0.6)
- **Dependency Path**: pre-commit > cross-spawn
- **Advisory URL**: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3xgq-45jj-v275
- **Type of Vulnerability**: ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)

#### Description

The `cross-spawn` package before version 6.0.6 contains a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability. ReDoS attacks can cause applications to become unresponsive or crash by forcing them to process a cleverly crafted regular expression that takes an extremely long time to evaluate.

#### Impact

This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to cause a denial of service by providing input that triggers the vulnerable regular expression, leading to excessive CPU consumption and application unresponsiveness.

#### Fix Recommendation

The recommended fix is to update to `cross-spawn@6.0.6` or higher. However, this would require updating `pre-commit` to version 1.0.10, which is a breaking change.

```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

Note that using `--force` is required because this is a breaking change in a development dependency.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: Medium

- **Development Dependency Only**: The vulnerability exists in `pre-commit`, which is a development dependency only used during development and not in production.
- **Limited Attack Vector**: Since this is a development tool, the attack surface is limited to developers' machines rather than production environments.
- **GitHub Actions Environment**: In the CI/CD pipeline, these dependencies are only used temporarily during the build process.

### Potential Mitigations

1. **Update with Breaking Changes**: Run `npm audit fix --force` to update to safer versions, then test thoroughly to ensure the pre-commit hooks still function correctly.

2. **Alternative Package**: Consider replacing `pre-commit` with another package like `husky` which is more actively maintained.

3. **Ignore in CI**: The current approach of allowing the security scan to continue without failing the build is acceptable for CI, given this is a development dependency with limited exposure.

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term**: Keep the current CI configuration that reports but doesn't fail on these vulnerabilities.

2. **Medium-term**: Plan to update or replace the `pre-commit` package in a dedicated ticket to address these vulnerabilities.

3. **Documentation**: Add a note to the project documentation about the known vulnerabilities and mitigation plan.

## Conclusion

The identified vulnerabilities are in development dependencies only and pose limited risk to the production application. They should be addressed as part of ongoing dependency maintenance rather than as an immediate security concern. The CI pipeline has been configured to report these issues without failing builds so that development can continue while these issues are addressed in a planned manner.
