# Implement File Length Enforcement (dw-10)

## Task Description

Implement file length enforcement in the codebase to encourage maintainable file sizes by configuring warnings at 500 lines and errors at 1000 lines.

## Classification

This is a **Simple** task that involves configuring linting rules for file length enforcement.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research File Length Enforcement Options**

   - Determine which tools (ESLint, Prettier, dedicated plugins) can enforce file length limits
   - Research best practices for file length enforcement in front-end projects
   - Identify how to configure different thresholds for warnings and errors

2. **Configure ESLint for File Length Enforcement**

   - Update ESLint configuration to add rules for file length
   - Configure warning at 500 lines
   - Configure error at 1000 lines
   - Set appropriate exceptions if needed (e.g., for test files or generated code)

3. **Add File Length Check to Pre-commit Hooks**

   - Ensure ESLint file length checks run as part of pre-commit hooks
   - Configure the hooks to prevent commits of files exceeding the error threshold

4. **Update Documentation**

   - Document file length standards in CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Add rationale for the chosen limits

5. **Test the Implementation**
   - Verify that the warnings and errors are triggered correctly
   - Test with files of different lengths

## Expected Deliverables

- Updated ESLint configuration with file length rules
- Updated documentation covering file length standards
- Verification that the rules are enforced during pre-commit checks
