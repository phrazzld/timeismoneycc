# CI Failure Audit

## PR #7 - Dev Workflow & Quality Standards (May 5, 2025)

### Failure Summary

The CI pipeline for PR #7 ("Dev Workflow & Quality Standards Implementation") has failed in the "Install dependencies" step with exit code 127.

### Error Details

```
> timeismoneycc@1.0.0 prepare
> pre-commit install

sh: 1: pre-commit: not found
npm error code 127
npm error path /home/runner/work/timeismoneycc/timeismoneycc
npm error command failed
npm error command sh -c pre-commit install
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The failure occurs because:

1. The `package.json` file has a `prepare` script that runs `pre-commit install` as part of `npm install`
2. The `pre-commit` command is not available in the CI environment at this point because it hasn't been installed yet
3. This creates a circular dependency: the `pre-commit` package needs to be installed by npm first, but npm tries to run the `prepare` script which requires `pre-commit` to already be installed

This is a common issue with pre-commit hooks and the npm `prepare` script.

### Recommended Fix

We need to modify the `prepare` script in `package.json` to check if `pre-commit` is installed before trying to run it. Here are two possible solutions:

#### Solution 1: Conditional Execution

Replace the current `prepare` script with a version that checks if pre-commit is installed:

```json
"prepare": "which pre-commit > /dev/null && pre-commit install || echo 'pre-commit not installed, skipping hooks installation'"
```

#### Solution 2: Move to a Separate Script

1. Remove the `pre-commit install` command from the `prepare` script
2. Create a new script for installing hooks:

```json
"prepare": "echo 'Installing dependencies...'",
"prepare-hooks": "pre-commit install",
"postinstall": "npm run prepare-hooks || echo 'Skipping hook installation'"
```

#### Solution 3: Use npx (Preferred)

Use `npx` to ensure the command is only run if available:

```json
"prepare": "npx --no-install pre-commit install || echo 'Skipping pre-commit installation'"
```

### Implementation Plan

1. Modify the `package.json` file to use Solution 3 (npx approach)
2. Commit the changes with message: `fix(ci): prevent pre-commit installation failure in CI`
3. Push the changes to the PR branch
4. Verify that the CI pipeline succeeds

This fix will ensure that the `pre-commit install` command is only run if the pre-commit package is already available, preventing the circular dependency issue in the CI pipeline.

## PR #6 - Setup GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

## Failure Summary

The CI workflow failed in the "Validate HTML" step. This step uses the Cyb3r-Jak3/html5validator-action@v7.2.0 action to validate the HTML files in the repository.

## Identified HTML Issues

After examining the index.html file, I've identified several HTML5 validation issues:

1. **Missing alt attribute on image**:

   ```html
   <img id="brand-image" src="images/icon.png" />
   ```

   The `alt` attribute is required for accessibility.

2. **Unclosed span tag**:

   ```html
   <span id="pay-frequency">hourly</span></span>
   ```

   There appears to be an extra closing `</span>` tag.

3. **Meta tag spacing issue**:
   Line 9 has a meta tag immediately followed by a link tag without proper spacing:

   ```html
   <meta name="author" content="phaedrus" /> <link rel="stylesheet" href="..." />
   ```

4. **Improper nesting in footer**:
   The footer element has Bootstrap grid classes directly applied to it, which may not be valid:
   ```html
   <footer
     id="site-info"
     class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"
   ></footer>
   ```

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Add alt attribute to image**:

   ```html
   <img id="brand-image" src="images/icon.png" alt="Time Is Money logo" />
   ```

2. **Fix span tag closure**:
   Review and correct the span nesting in the income display section.

3. **Fix meta tag spacing**:
   Move the link tag to a new line:

   ```html
   <meta name="author" content="phaedrus" />
   <link
     rel="stylesheet"
     href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"
   />
   ```

4. **Fix footer structure**:
   Wrap the footer content in a div with the Bootstrap classes:
   ```html
   <footer>
     <div id="site-info" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
       <hr />
       <p id="copyright"></p>
     </div>
   </footer>
   ```

## Action Plan

1. Create a fix branch from the current PR branch
2. Implement the HTML fixes listed above
3. Configure the HTML validator in CI to better match project needs:
   - Consider adding options to customize error checking
   - Add error details to the CI output
4. Create a PR with these fixes and merge to the CI setup branch
5. Enhance the project with HTML linting as part of pre-commit hooks
