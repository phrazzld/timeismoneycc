# Task Plan: Enforce Conventional Commit Format

## Current State

- Pre-commit framework is installed
- Linting and formatting checks are configured
- Sensitive data detection hooks are configured
- There is no enforcement of commit message format yet

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Conventional Commits Format**

   - Understand the core requirements of the Conventional Commits specification
   - Identify the most suitable tools for enforcing this format

2. **Install and Configure Commitlint**

   - Install commitlint and the conventional commits configuration
   - Create configuration file for commitlint
   - Configure commitlint to validate Conventional Commits format

3. **Set Up Commit Message Hook**

   - Configure commit-msg hook via pre-commit framework
   - Ensure commitlint runs on every commit message
   - Test with various valid and invalid commit messages

4. **Add Commit Message Template (Optional)**

   - Create a commit message template to guide developers
   - Configure git to use this template by default

5. **Document Convention**
   - Update README or CONTRIBUTING with clear examples and instructions
   - Include explanation of conventional commit types and format

## Implementation Details

### 1. Install Required Tools

- Install commitlint CLI and conventional config
- Install husky for git hooks management (if needed)

### 2. Configure Commitlint

- Create commitlint.config.js with conventional commits rules
- Customize rules based on project requirements (if needed)

### 3. Set Up Pre-commit Hook

- Configure the commit-msg hook to run commitlint
- Ensure proper error messages are shown when conventions aren't followed

### 4. Testing

- Test with valid commit messages
- Test with invalid commit messages to ensure rejection
- Verify proper error messages are displayed

## Success Criteria

- All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits format
- Invalid commit messages should be rejected with clear error messages
- Documentation should be updated to explain the format
- The pre-commit hook should be properly configured to enforce the format
