# Task Plan: Install Pre-commit Framework

## Task Description
Install and configure the pre-commit framework for the Time Is Money project to enable Git hooks for automated quality checks before commits.

## Implementation Approach
1. Install the pre-commit tool via pip (Python package manager)
2. Create a basic `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file
3. Set up the framework to be ready for future hooks
4. Update the package.json file to include pre-commit installation commands
5. Document the setup in the README.md's development section

## Reasoning
The pre-commit framework provides a language-agnostic way to manage Git hooks. It supports a wide range of built-in hooks and allows for custom hooks. This aligns with the Development Philosophy's emphasis on automation and code quality.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add pre-commit as a dev dependency
2. Create an initial configuration file
3. Set up basic hooks that don't require additional configuration
4. Add commands to package.json for easy installation
5. Update documentation

## Expected Outcome
A working pre-commit framework that can be easily installed by developers and is ready for additional hooks to be configured in subsequent tasks.
