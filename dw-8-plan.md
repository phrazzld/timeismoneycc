# Configure Post-Commit Hooks (dw-8)

## Task Description

Configure post-commit hooks to run non-blocking tasks after successful commits, including running `glance ./` asynchronously and generating documentation updates if needed.

## Classification

This is a **Simple** task that involves configuring post-commit hooks in the existing pre-commit framework.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Post-Commit Hook Options**

   - Research how to configure post-commit hooks with the pre-commit framework
   - Understand the best way to run tasks asynchronously after commit

2. **Create a Post-Commit Hook Configuration**

   - Add post-commit hook configuration to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Configure hooks to run asynchronously (non-blocking)

3. **Implement `glance ./` Hook**

   - Create a script to run `glance ./` asynchronously
   - Add this as a post-commit hook

4. **Implement Documentation Update Hook**

   - Create a script to check if documentation needs updating based on changes
   - Add this as a post-commit hook

5. **Test the Implementation**
   - Verify that hooks run successfully after commit
   - Ensure they run asynchronously and don't block the developer

## Expected Deliverables

- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with post-commit hooks
- Any necessary scripts for running the hooks
- Documentation on how the post-commit hooks work
