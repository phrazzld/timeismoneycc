# T018 - Summary of Changes

## Task T018: Refactor state transition tests to focus on observable behavior

### Key Changes

1. Added a `getDisplayState` helper function to capture observable DOM state instead of directly accessing internal implementation details
2. Restructured test cases to focus on what users would observe in the UI rather than internal state mechanisms
3. Reorganized tests into logical groups (Cycle Tests, Individual Transitions, Error Handling)
4. Used proper TypeScript typing with null coalescing operators for safer DOM access
5. Improved test structure to follow best practices for behavior-driven testing
6. Ensured all tests pass and maintain full coverage

### Benefits

1. Tests are now more resistant to implementation changes
2. Focus is on actual observable behavior rather than implementation details
3. Better organization of test cases makes the test file more maintainable
4. Improved type safety with proper TypeScript return types and null handling
5. More readable test structure with clear expectations and states

### Completion Status

- Task is completed and all tests are passing
- Changes follow the code style and conventions in the codebase
- No regressions were introduced
- TODO.md has been updated to mark T018 as complete
