# T016 - Document CI workflow in readme

## Task Details

- **Task:** Document ci workflow in readme
- **Context:** PLAN.md - Success Criteria #4
- **Action:**
  1. Add a section to `README.md` explaining the CI pipeline.
  2. Describe the quality gates enforced (lint, types, tests, coverage, security).
  3. Briefly mention how to troubleshoot common failures.

## Implementation Plan

1. Read the current README.md to understand its structure and where to add the CI documentation
2. Draft a clear and concise section about the CI workflow
3. Include information about:
   - The quality gates and what they check for
   - How to run checks locally before committing
   - How to troubleshoot common CI failures
   - Where to find more detailed documentation (e.g., CI-TEST-PLAN.md)

## Key Considerations

- Keep the documentation concise but informative
- Make it easy for new contributors to understand the CI process
- Include links to more detailed documentation where appropriate
- Ensure the documentation aligns with the project's style and tone
