# T006 · Test · P1: Ensure all tests pass in `tests/scripts.test.ts`

## Task Description

- Run `npm test` to check if all tests pass with the refactored TypeScript test file
- Debug and fix any test failures
- Verify test coverage meets or exceeds existing project thresholds

## Implementation Approach

1. Run `npm test` to see if all tests already pass with our T005 changes
2. If there are test failures, debug the issues and fix them
3. Run the tests with coverage to verify we meet coverage thresholds
4. Update TODO.md to mark T006 as completed once all tests pass

## Success Criteria

- `npm test` completes successfully with 0 failures
- Test coverage meets or exceeds the existing project threshold
