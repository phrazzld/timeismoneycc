# Configure Pre-Push Hooks (dw-9)

## Task Description

Configure pre-push hooks to run the complete test suite and enforce branch naming conventions before pushing to the remote repository.

## Classification

This is a **Simple** task that involves configuring pre-push hooks in the existing pre-commit framework.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Pre-Push Hook Options**

   - Research how to configure pre-push hooks with the pre-commit framework
   - Determine how to enforce branch naming conventions
   - Understand best practices for running tests before push

2. **Create Pre-Push Hook Configuration**

   - Add pre-push hook configuration to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Configure hooks to run the complete test suite with coverage
   - Add hook to check branch naming conventions

3. **Implement Branch Naming Enforcement**

   - Create a script to validate branch names against our conventions
   - Configure regex patterns for valid branch names (feature/, bugfix/, docs/, etc.)
   - Add helpful error messages if branch naming doesn't meet conventions

4. **Update Documentation**

   - Document the pre-push hooks in README.md
   - Add information about branch naming conventions to CONTRIBUTING.md

5. **Test the Implementation**
   - Verify that hooks run successfully before push
   - Test with valid and invalid branch names

## Expected Deliverables

- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with pre-push hooks
- Branch naming validation script
- Updated documentation on branch naming conventions
