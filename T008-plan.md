# T008 · Chore · P1: Build `scripts.ts` to `dist/scripts.js`

## Task Description

- Run `npm run build` to compile `scripts.ts` to `dist/scripts.js`
- Verify that the build process completes successfully
- Confirm that `dist/scripts.js` is generated correctly

## Implementation Approach

1. Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code
2. Verify that `dist/scripts.js` exists and contains the expected compiled JavaScript
3. Update TODO.md to mark T008 as completed once the build is successful

## Success Criteria

- The build process completes without errors
- `dist/scripts.js` is generated from `scripts.ts`
