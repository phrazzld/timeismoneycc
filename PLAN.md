# Refactor Plan: Data-Driven `shiftExample` Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the `shiftExample` function in the "Time Is Money" Chrome extension to use a data-driven approach rather than extensive conditional logic.

## Problem Statement

The current implementation of the `shiftExample` function uses multiple conditional statements (if/else) to determine which currency/income configuration to display next. This approach:

1. Is verbose and difficult to maintain
2. Makes the code flow harder to follow
3. Requires multiple condition checks for each state transition
4. Makes adding new currency examples cumbersome
5. Mixes state transition logic with DOM manipulation

## Solution: Data-Driven Approach

### Core Concept

Replace the conditional branching with a data structure that:

1. Defines clear states for each currency configuration
2. Enables simple, predictable cycling through these configurations
3. Separates state definition from state application

### Implementation Details

1. Define a `CurrencyState` interface representing the properties of each currency configuration
2. Create an array of predefined currency states
3. Add helper functions to:
   - Find the current state based on DOM values
   - Apply a state to the DOM elements
4. Refactor `shiftExample` to use these new components

### Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**:

   - Explicit, centralized state definitions
   - Reduced complexity (removing nested conditionals)
   - Separation of concerns (state definition vs. DOM manipulation)

2. **Enhanced Extensibility**:

   - Adding a new currency state only requires adding it to the array
   - No need to modify the application logic

3. **Better Testability**:

   - State transitions are more predictable and testable
   - Helper functions can be tested in isolation
   - Explicit state definitions make edge cases clearer

4. **Code Size Reduction**:
   - Fewer lines of code overall
   - Elimination of redundant condition checks
   - More concise state transition logic

## Implementation Steps

1. ✅ Analyze the existing `shiftExample` function
2. ✅ Define a clear `CurrencyState` interface
3. ✅ Create the array of predefined currency states
4. ✅ Implement helper functions for finding and applying states
5. ✅ Refactor the main `shiftExample` function
6. ✅ Update tests to verify the new implementation
7. ✅ Test all transitions to ensure equivalence with the original function

## Testing Strategy

1. Maintain all existing tests to ensure functionality remains the same
2. Add new tests specifically for the data-driven components:
   - Verify the currency states array contains all expected states
   - Test the state index finder with various inputs
   - Test the state application function
   - Verify full cycle transitions

## Conclusion

This data-driven refactoring aligns with our development philosophy by reducing complexity, improving maintainability, and making the code more modular. It provides a more structured and explicit approach to managing state transitions, making future modifications easier and less error-prone.
