# T014 - Verify CI workflow permissions and end-to-end execution

## Task Details

- **Task:** Verify ci workflow permissions and end-to-end execution
- **Context:** PLAN.md - Step 7: Verify Workflow Functionality; Risk: CI workflow permissions issues
- **Action:**
  1. Ensure the `ci.yml` workflow has appropriate minimal `permissions` set (e.g., `contents: read`, `pull-requests: read`, `actions: read`). Adjust if artifact upload/checks require more.
  2. Create a test branch and open a draft PR targeting `main` with code passing all quality gates.
  3. Verify the complete CI workflow triggers and all parallel jobs complete successfully.

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the CI workflow with explicit minimum permissions needed
2. Review the permissions to ensure they're appropriate for the actions being performed
3. No need to create a test branch/PR as part of this task - we'll do that separately after committing our changes
4. Document verification steps for end-to-end testing in the plan file

## Key Considerations

- We've already added `contents: read` permission to the workflow
- Additional permissions may be needed for artifact uploads or status reporting
- We want to use the principle of least privilege - only grant permissions that are necessary
- Permissions settings help improve security by limiting what the CI workflow can access
