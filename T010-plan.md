# T010: Refactor Global Script Initialization to Init Function

## Context

Currently, the `scripts.ts` file contains self-executing function calls in the global scope:

- `startExampleInterval()` at line 10
- `applyCopyrightText()` at line 122

This is not ideal for several reasons:

1. It runs code immediately upon import of the module
2. It makes testing more difficult
3. It doesn't allow consumers of the code to control initialization timing

## Approach

We will:

1. Create and export a new `initializeApplication()` function
2. Move the calls to `startExampleInterval()` and `applyCopyrightText()` inside this function
3. Update tests to verify the initialization function works correctly
4. Remove the self-executing function calls from the global scope

This approach allows:

- Better control over when initialization happens
- Improved testability of the codebase
- More explicit orchestration of application startup
- Code that better adheres to our development philosophy of modularity and testability

## Implementation Steps

1. Create an `initializeApplication()` function in scripts.ts
2. Move the existing function calls into this new function
3. Export the function
4. Remove the self-executing calls from the global scope
5. Update tests to verify the initialization function calls both required functions
6. Verify all TypeScript checks pass with `npx tsc --noEmit`
7. Verify tests pass with `npm test`

## Expected Outcome

- The scripts.ts file no longer has self-executing code in the global scope
- A new exported function orchestrates initialization
- Tests verify the initialization function works correctly
- All TypeScript checks and existing tests continue to pass

## Dependencies

None, this is a self-contained task
