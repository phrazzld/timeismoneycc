# T010 · Chore · P2: Remove legacy `scripts.js` source file from project root

## Task Description

- Delete the legacy `scripts.js` file from the project root directory
- Verify that the application still builds and runs correctly

## Implementation Approach

1. Verify that `index.html` is now pointing to the compiled TypeScript file in the dist directory
2. Delete the legacy `scripts.js` file from the project root
3. Verify the application still builds correctly
4. Update TODO.md to mark T010 as completed

## Success Criteria

- The legacy `scripts.js` file is deleted from the project root
- The application still builds and runs correctly (the built version in dist/scripts.js is not affected)
