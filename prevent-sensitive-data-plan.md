# Task Plan: Prevent Commit of Sensitive Data and Large Files

## Current State

- Pre-commit framework is installed
- Linting and formatting checks are configured
- Basic pre-commit hooks are set up in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Some hooks are already in place for checking large files and detecting private keys

## Implementation Plan

1. **Enhance Existing Hooks**

   - Verify the existing `check-added-large-files` hook configuration
   - Verify the existing `detect-private-key` hook configuration
   - Update their settings if necessary

2. **Add Sensitive Data Detection**

   - Add `detect-secrets` hook for comprehensive secret detection
   - Configure it to detect various types of sensitive data:
     - API keys
     - Database connection strings
     - Passwords
     - OAuth tokens
     - AWS access keys
     - Other common secrets

3. **Add Configuration for gitignore Verification**

   - Add `check-case-conflict` hook to prevent case-sensitivity issues
   - Add `forbid-binary` hook to prevent binary files unless explicitly allowed
   - Add `check-executables-have-shebangs` hook for script files

4. **Create Documentation**
   - Update README to explain sensitive data protection measures
   - Document the hooks and what they protect against
   - Include information on how to handle exceptions if needed

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhance Existing Hooks

- Review the current `check-added-large-files` configuration
- Adjust size limits if necessary based on project needs
- Ensure `detect-private-key` is properly configured

### 2. Add Sensitive Data Detection

- Install and configure `detect-secrets` pre-commit hook
- Create a baseline of existing secrets (if any)
- Configure to detect common patterns for secrets

### 3. Additional Protective Hooks

- Add hooks for additional checks to prevent common issues

### 4. Testing

- Test the hooks with sample data containing dummy secrets
- Verify that legitimate large files (if any are needed) can be added through exceptions
- Document the process for bypassing hooks in legitimate cases (e.g., using `--no-verify` which should be discouraged but documented)

## Success Criteria

- Pre-commit hooks successfully detect and prevent commit of sensitive data
- Pre-commit hooks prevent commit of excessively large files
- Documentation is updated to reflect the changes
- All current legitimate files in the repository still pass the checks
